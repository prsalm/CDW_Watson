## Configuring PyCharm

If you are going to run the server locally from within PyCharm, the new robotserver directory that contains 
the source must be made into a Source Root.  In PyCharm...

1. Right-click on robotserver directory and Mark Directory as... Sources Root.
2. Change the runtime by going to "app" pulldown (upper right of IDE)... Edit Configurations... and set Working Directory to the robotserver directory path.
